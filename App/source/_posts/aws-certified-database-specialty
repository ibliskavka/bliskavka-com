TODO LINK: I got my [AWS Database Specialty](https://www.credly.com/badges/c47ce3e4-9f4b-4c4d-ad13-227f6a8b1b47/linked_in?t=rhu502)!

I already have my Solution Architect and Data Analytics certificates so this one didn't feel very difficult.

## Study Guide

I watched the video course and did the following practice exams. Preparation took about 2-3 weeks.
