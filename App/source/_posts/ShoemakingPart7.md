Well, its been two years and about 24 pairs later that I’ve finally found the time and the initiative to update this series.

<!-- more -->

The plan is to include this derby pattern tutorial, then another past soon-ish with assembly instructions, and then follow up with an oxford and boot pattern guides whenever I make the next pairs in those categories. There are a few ways out there to make patterns, most of them are complex and esoteric. If you’ve ever seen pictures of the geometric method, there is a lot going on and its a bit overwhelming. This is the method I learned at Stefano Bemer, and so far the most simple and effective that I’ve used. The best part is, it just works. You don’t really have to know why things are the way they are to create a working pattern that fits the last perfectly.

Here are the tools I use when making a pattern.

First order of business is marking a center line on your last. I lay out a piece of masking tape, draw a straight line through it with a straight edge, then cut it to a more manageable width. I start by finding the center on the toe, get the tape attached there, then do a straight shot to the midpoint on the top of the last. Laying the tape down straight is the tricky part! Do the same thing for the heel.

I use a REALLY thick masking tape for this, but you can just use normal tape and lay it all out. afterwards, trim everything off along the center line. It doesn’t matter what side you tape up, I prefer the right foot mostly because that’s what’s shown in the reference material I use.
