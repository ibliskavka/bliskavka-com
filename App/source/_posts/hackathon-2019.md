- Tips

  - Don't be greedy. More members on your team means you can get more done and build something impressive - we had the max at 8. It was an 8-way split, but I dont think we would have won with 4.
  - Focus on what makes your app special. Dont worry about the login screen and user management, you can fake that for the purpose of the presentation.
    - The goal of a hackathon is to pitch and idea and create a Proof-of-Concept.
  - Exploit existing skills - not everyone needs to be a developer.
    - You need someone to work on the pitch, someone to present, and someone to keep notes.
    - I had experience with Amazon Connect and experience leading a team, so I took that role.
  - Check in often. We had a standup every 90 minutes to check progress.
  - If something isn't working, its OK to pivot to an alternative.
    - Initially we were designing an Express API but the time to design and implement was taking too long. In the end we used a single serverless function in AWS Lambda.
  - Include business metrics in the presentation!
    - We included an estimated cost of our platform vs a commercial contact center.
    - The decision makers are typically not technical and dont care about the tech, they care about the business results.
  - Have fun and don't take it too seriously.
    - We called our submission EDNA, and our key persona was Grandma EDNA. It's OK to work in some humor and be a little tongue-in-cheek.
