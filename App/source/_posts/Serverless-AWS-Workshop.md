> AWS is taking over the wold. So it's time we had a workshop to learn it. -Damian Montero, FloridaJS

<!-- more -->

I will be presenting a virtual workshop on how to create installable, serverless applications in AWS.

This will be whirlwind tour covering:

- Frontend: React w/ AWS Amplify
- Hosting: S3 with CloudFront and Route53 for DNS
- Authentication: AWS Cognito with self-sign up
- Backend: Lambda with API GW
- Storage: S3 + DynamoDB

All of those topics deserve their own workshops - but fortunately we only have to cover the highlights! With the magic of __Infrastructure as Code__ you can replicate the __workshop project__ in your own AWS environment in about _15-30 minutes_.
