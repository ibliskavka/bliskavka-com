I created a screen saver app for Uiversal Windows Platform. You can find it in the [Windows Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/screen-saver-gallery/9nblggh5j8tx "Screen Saver Gallery Download Link")

It is a slideshow that sources high quality images from the imgur.com API. It's not quite a screen saver because it does not auto-start - the option is not available for Windows Store Apps
