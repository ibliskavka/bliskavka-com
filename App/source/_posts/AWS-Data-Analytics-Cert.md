I got my [AWS Data Analytics Specialty](https://www.credly.com/badges/c47ce3e4-9f4b-4c4d-ad13-227f6a8b1b47/linked_in?t=rhu502)!

I already had a lot of experience with Kinesis, Athena, and RedShift but there is A LOT of material in this exam. I highly recommend [practice exams by Stephane Maarek](https://www.udemy.com/course/practice-exams-aws-certified-data-analytics-specialty/) because they explain why you got something wrong, and you can adjust before taking the real thing!
