There has been a lot of HYPE at the office around AI and ChatGPT. Organizational leaders and clients are looking for the AI angle.

<!-- more -->

I didn't jump on the bandwagon immediately, because technology has hypes, booms, and busts.

For example: Bitcoin has been around for a while, and has had a pretty good run, but it seams to be falling out of favor. I know there are use cases, but the typical conversation I heard were around making a quick buck through speculation and not solving as specific problem.

Somewhat recently there was a bunch of hype around NFTs. Some folks even made a bunch of money on them. Personally I never saw the point so I never followed it.

Now ChatGPT is on the scene and there is a lot of hype. I work in the Contact Center space, and we actually build chat bots for clients, so I have some vested interest in this technology. GPT-4 came out in March 2023 apnd its still going strong. Microsoft even acquired OpenAI and is integrating the model into Bing, Edge, etc.

I am a consultant, and a tool/solution builder, so I decided to dig in and see how this may fit into my world.

## Reading List

### ChatGPT for Dummies

_Pam Baker_

I found this book to be an excellent introduction. It offered good background in laymans terms and was very easy to follow. I'ts also very explicit about the limitations of the models. GPT is great at generating content, but its terrible with facts.

### Developing Apps with GPT-4 and Chat GPT

_Oliveier Caelen and Marie-Alice Blete_

This was a great followup to the first book. I read the early release but the authors dive deeper into the differences between the OpenAI models and how they affect pricing.

As a developer, I found the code samples useful. The authors showed examples of using `Completion` and `Insertion` commands and also covered some cost control topics. I look forward to the full version of this book!

### The ChatGPT GoldRush: Profiting from the AI Revolution Online: Prompt Engineering Mastery with ChatGPT

_Mark Adelson_

This book might be useful if you are looking to use ChatGPT to create a bunch of ChatGPT content for your blog.

The title looks like click-bait for a reason, because it is. The book is full of lists that include a heading, and a small paragraph. Along with a list of tools and a prompt dump.
