I am now a certified [AWS Solution Architect Professional](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/dd8154b4-ccf9-46ce-a5c6-2bdb7dfc99fc/linked_in)!

I am very proud of this. It's probably the most difficult test I have ever taken. 2.5 years of AWS experience and 40+ hours of training video.

I do a fair amount of moonlighting after hours. If you need some expert assistance in Serverless, ECS, or CloudFormation, you can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ibliskavka).
