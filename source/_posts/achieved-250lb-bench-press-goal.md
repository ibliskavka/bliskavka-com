For my 2022 new year's resolution I decided on: 250 lb for 1 rep on the bench press. Almost 2 years later, I finally got it.

  - 12/30/21 - 212.5 @ ~163lb
  - March '22, my friend Noel commented that if I want to hit my goal should be eating even if I have no appetite.
  - 6/16/22 - 215 @ ~175lb
  - 11/28/22 - 225 @ ~176lb
  - 3/16/23 - 230 @ ~176lb
  - 6/5/23 - 235 @ ~176lb

- I tried to maintain a lean physique which slowed down gains
- I have been doing 100+ pushups every day since last August. I think has kept me near my peak performance, so I hit PRs more often.
  - Previously my PRs were 3-6 months apart because I would slack off for a bit after each milestone
- Its super important to keep a log and a consistent routine
- It's less important to work near your max weight when not working towards a PR.
  - Instead do 5 sets at 5 reps at 80% of max. Increase reps or weight slowly over a couple weeks.
