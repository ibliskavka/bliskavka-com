I am very excited to announce that Screen Saver Gallery is finally live on Roku!

[Roku](https://www.roku.com/products/roku-express) is a device that can turn any TV into a streaming smart TV for as little as $25!

2. Leave a 5 Star Review

## Great new features

- Auto Start
  - Unlike Windows and Xbox - Roku supports screensaver apps, so the screen saver will auto-start when the TV is inactive.

  - I am making the most popular categories free, with no ads, and no subscription required.
- 75 Photo Categories Total
  - I expanded the category selection to 75! Mix and match the categories to get a photo mix that fits your personality
