I am a [Staff+](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/what-is-a-staff-engineer) engineer at TTEC Digital where my primary focus is optimizing call center experiences using AI technologies. In my leisure time, I enjoy CrossFit, traveling, and beaches.

I consider myself extremely lucky to do the work that I love. I find myself consulting and moonlighting on interesting projects because my passion is not coding per se; I enjoy solving technical problems and optimizing processes through code.

I am passionate about my work and love connecting with like-minded people. If you would like to chat, please grab a slot during my [Office Hours](/Contact), or let's connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ibliskavka)!
