## Me

I love to code. When I was a kid I wanted to be an inventor like Edison or Tesla. Building software is that for me. Each project has it's own obstacles and the output is unique in some way. I invent little logic mechanisms all day long. I am a digital inventor.

One of my goals is to develop and _publish_ 1-2 apps a year. Some make money, but most are just interesting to write :)
